# OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 — throughline source

This document is **generated from the graph** by `tl docs`; `tl docs --check` gates
it in CI. The prose headings are hand-owned — everything between `tl:*` markers is
injected from the YAML items, so the published spec can never drift from the graph.

This source is a faithful, complete cut of **OWASP ASVS v5.0.0**: every chapter is
a `user_requirement`, and every verification requirement is a `system_requirement`
that `implements` its chapter. The published ASVS number lives in `attrs.source_ref`
(e.g. `V1.1.1`); the ASVS level in `attrs.level`. The throughline UIDs are this
source's own and immutable — a consumer cites a clause as `asvs:SR-0001`, never by its
ASVS number.

It carries

## Purpose

<!-- tl:item INT-0001 -->
**INT-0001 — An application's security is verifiable against a graded, testable baseline** — `intent`, status `approved`

> The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard exists so that an application's security controls can be verified against a normative, level-graded set of requirements — giving developers, testers and procurers a shared baseline rather than ad-hoc judgement.
