# throughline-asvs

The **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)** expressed as a
[throughline](https://pypi.org/project/throughline/) **source** — a standalone,
grounded requirements graph that a consuming project composes with
[throughline-compose](https://github.com/rhodium-org/throughline-compose).

This repository holds no code. It is a directory of small YAML items with permanent
UIDs, validated by `tl check`. Consumers import it under a namespace and reference
its clauses as `asvs:SR-0003`.

## Status

The **complete v4.0.3 edition** —
<!-- tl:count type == 'user_requirement' -->
14
<!-- tl:end --> chapters and
<!-- tl:count type == 'system_requirement' -->
278
<!-- tl:end --> verification requirements, generated from OWASP's official
machine-readable export and published to [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md):

- `INT-0001` — the root intent (why ASVS exists), `normative: false`.
- Chapters `V1`…`V14` as `user_requirement`s that `derives_from` the intent.
- Every non-retired verification requirement as a `system_requirement` that
  `implements` its chapter. (Clauses OWASP retired as `[DELETED]` in 4.0.3 carry no
  level and are intentionally omitted.)

The counts above are rendered from the live graph by the `tl:count` directive, so
they cannot drift. Re-run [`tools/generate_from_owasp.py`](tools/generate_from_owasp.py)
against a newer OWASP export to extend the graph; it preserves every existing
UID↔clause mapping and only allocates UIDs for clauses that have none yet.

## Modelling conventions

- **throughline UIDs are this source's own** (`SR-0001`…), immutable and never the
  ASVS number. The published number lives in `attrs.source_ref` (`"V2.1.1"`); the
  ASVS L1/L2/L3 grade in `attrs.level` (the lowest level at which the requirement
  applies).
- **Editions are release branches of this one repo.** This branch (`release/v4`) is
  the **v4.0.3** maintenance line (14 chapters, 278 requirements), tagged `v4.0.3`.
  The newest edition, **v5.0.0** (17 chapters, 345 requirements), lives on `main`,
  tagged `v5.0.0`. Each edition has its own UID space starting at `UR-0001`/`SR-0001`;
  a consumer pins the ref it wants (`ref = "v4.0.3"` or `"v5.0.0"`), and since only one
  ref is resolved, the editions never collide.

## Composing it

In a consuming throughline project's `throughline.toml`:

```toml
[[sources]]
namespace = "asvs"
path = "vendor/throughline-asvs"   # or a pinned checkout
```

Then reference a clause from your own items:

```yaml
links:
- target: asvs:SR-0003          # ASVS V2.1.1, minimum password length
  type: satisfies
```

`tl-compose check` resolves the reference; bare `tl check` fails fast and points you
at `tl-compose`.

## Local checks

```sh
pip install throughline
tl check --strict     # the graph must stay sound
tl docs --check       # docs/spec.md must match the graph
```
